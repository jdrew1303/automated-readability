Formula to detect the ease of reading a text according to the [Automated Readability Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Readability_Index).

## Installation

npm:
```sh
$ npm install automated-readability
```

Component:
```sh
$ component install wooorm/automated-readability
```

Bower:
```sh
$ bower install automated-readability
```

## Usage

```js
var automatedReadability = require('automated-readability');

/**
 * For:
 *
 * The rule of rhythm in prose is not so intricate. Here,
 * too, we write in groups, or phrases, as I prefer to call
 * them, for the prose phrase is greatly longer and is much
 * more nonchalantly uttered than the group in verse; so
 * that not only is there a greater interval of continuous
 * sound between the pauses, but, for that very reason,
 * word is linked more readily to word by a more summary
 * enunciation. Still, the phrase is the strict analogue
 * of the group, and successive phrases, like successive
 * groups, must differ openly in length and rhythm. The
 * rule of scansion in verse is to suggest no measure but
 * the one in hand; in prose, to suggest no measure at all.
 * Prose must be rhythmical, and it may be as much so as
 * you will; but it must not be metrical. It may be
 * anything, but it must not be verse.
 *
 * Containing 6 sentences, 151 words, and 623 characters.
